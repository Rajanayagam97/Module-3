# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
tuplex = ("s", 3, "a", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print("r" in tuplex)
print(5 in tuplex)
```
## Output
<img width="784" height="180" alt="517736172-d3044e41-dd8c-448b-a824-ad438340bd09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63d24468-6fbe-4826-8986-d206889dd70b" />

## Result
The program successfully checks the existence of elements in the tuple.
